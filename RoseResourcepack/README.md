# RoseResourcepack
 Hosting and packaging of the resource pack in the plugin

With this plugin you will be able to upload your resource pack files and compress them into an archive using /roserp zip. After your resource pack archive has been created, you can apply the resource pack in the game with the /roserp texture command. There are only two commands. No need to manually upload the resource pack to cloud servers, the plugin does it for you.
